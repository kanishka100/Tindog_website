topic 2: combining selectors
1.multiple selectors

Syntax : selector1,selector2{
            //do something
            }
2.Hierarchical selectors- based on how html is structured. Here the space is must.Selector1 belongs to parent and selector2 belongs to parent.
Always read the selectors from the right to the left.
Syntax : selector1 selector2{
            //do something
            }
3.Combined selectors-there is no space between 2 selectors you are combining. When there is no space read from left to right.Here the selector1 has the selector 2 not as a child but inline to it.
Syntax: selector1selector2{
            //do something
            }
